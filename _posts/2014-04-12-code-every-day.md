Yesterday i was reading some posts and saw something cool ([here](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)). A challenge adopted by Jonh Resig [[@jeresig](https://twitter.com/jeresig)] (the creator of the jQuery JavaScript library). The goal was to code every single day.

After read this post, I chose try do this too. But  have some rules to be followed.

### Rules

• I must write code every day. I can write docs, or blog posts, or other things but it must be in addition to the code that I write.

• It must be useful code. No tweaking indentation, no code re-formatting, and if at all possible no refactoring. (All these things are permitted, but not as the exclusive work of the day.)

• All code must be written before midnight.

• The code must be Open Source and up on Github.


And you will try too?
