Every person I know ever used or heard of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (my favorite text editor). Is very difficult not to love it. What tools and plugins i use in Sublime? What tools you should know (or be using)?

###Themes or Color Schemes

I love to use Monokai (default), [Earthsong](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes), [Dracula](https://github.com/zenorocha/dracula-theme) and [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray). But there are others too like [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland), [Nexus](https://github.com/EleazarCrusader/nexus-theme), [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/), [Predawn](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn) and others.

###Plugins

There are known: [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/), [Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git), [JsFormat](https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat), [Prefixr](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_prefixr), [JsMinifier](https://github.com/cgutierrez/JsMinifier), [Bracket Highlighter](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter), [Less2Css](https://github.com/timdouglas/sublime-less2css) and others.

###Preferences
I like simple settings: font-size between 18 and 20, tab-size: 4 and open files in new window.

And your settings? Comment here :)
