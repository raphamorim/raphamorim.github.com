Here is my personal list of my favorite games, I think everyone should play
these before die. With time I'll updating the list.

<!-- more -->

The order of listing does not matter at all. I put numbers for ease of viewing
and reading.

### • Suikoden 2 (PS1)

![Suikoden 2](/assets/images/posts/games/suikoden.jpg)

Yes, definitely yes. Suikoden 2 is in my top 3. And by far is my favorite RPG. The plot, story, characters, soundtrack is so perfect. This is the game I've most played in all my life, I started and finished by about 14 times the same game.

After the third time, always ended with the real ending. 108 stars, right? The difficulty and brightness are these 108 stars. The story is exciting, you get down when Nanami die or when your best friend Jowy become his opponent in the war.

Another, the villain to me is cruel I've ever seen. Many speak in Sephiroth and some others, but no one has overcome Luca Blight. To defeat him was needed 12 characters.

The fighting style, recruitment, improvements in the castle, dialogues, engaging characters, war battles, mini-games ... Suikoden 2 has many, many good points to highlight.

### • Harvest Moon: Back to Nature (PS1)

![Harvest Moon: Back to Nature](/assets/images/posts/games/hm-back-to-nature.jpg)

Perhaps the question is, as a game with a simple premise is so good?

A game that is based only on developing a farm, harvest and planting, creating and maintaining relationships. In fact the game is very wide, at the time of the PS1 could not imagine a game who gives a the opportunity to play "years" with a character and see his evolution.

It's a really a lovely game, today I carry it with me both on PS3, PSP and PS Vita. It's great to spend time. I have started and finished this game by 10 times.

### •  Metal Gear Solid (PS1)

![Metal Gear Solid](/assets/images/posts/games/mgs.jpg)

Bitches, this is Solid Snake.

MGS, which used two CDs to play. It was absurdly good, enter the role of Solid Snake (a legend of spying for me) had the task of preventing a giant robot and stop a group with unusual abilities.

Now insert the genius of Hideo Kojima, we had an amazing game, with absurdly good script and a great gameplay

Maybe this game was the most decent pioneer of stealth games.

### • Brave Fencer Musashi (PS1)

![Brave Fencer Musashi](/assets/images/posts/games/brave-fencer-musashi.jpg)

I do not know exactly why this game is so good. I believe it is the game of the set has good parts.

The game brought a new concept of hero, Musashi (name based on one of the greatest swordsmen in history) is a boy who has no control over his mouth. And the game is stuffed or claims by their jokes, making it more fluid and funny.

Good dialogues and good gameplay.

### • Breath of Fire IV (PS1)

![Breath of Fire IV](/assets/images/posts/games/Breath-of-Fire-IV.jpg)

Spectacular JRPG. Brought new concepts of fighting.

His fighting style is fluid. And makes life easier for the player. Who was accustomed to Final Fantasy, BoF shows how a fight can be more fast and intuitive. Compared with its predecessors. BoF IV managed to create new elements, features that have left the game even more amazing.

But I would say that the idea to play with the villain of the game, is very good. Fou-lu (for me one of the best villains) has a visual and a very good story. The mini-games are also good points to highlight.

### • Radiata Stories (PS2)

![Radiata Stories](/assets/images/posts/games/radiata-stories.jpg)

Think of game with good plot, conversation (one of the best I've ever seen) and extremely free gameplay. Well, that's Radiata Stories

With extremely well crafted and funny dialogues. Radiata is certainly one of the games that deserves a seal of one of the best RPGs.

### • Persona 4

![Persona 4](/assets/images/posts/games/persona-4.jpg)

Best **mystery** game I played. Best game of **social interaction** that played

Good combat system and incredible dialogues. It's hard not to like Persona 4.

### • Pokemon Fire Red / Pokemon Silver (GameBoy)

![Pokemon Silver](/assets/images/posts/games/pokemon-silver.jpg)

Pokemon is Pokemon. Remarkable in my life. That young not played pokemon in school? or dreamed of being a pokemon trainer?

Be able to mount your Pokemon team was amazing and still is.

### • Pokemon Soul Silver (Nintendo DS)

![Pokemon Soul Silver](/assets/images/posts/games/pokemon-soul-silver.jpg)

We can say that made that remarkable game of my childhood even better, with a sequence of new things added to the game.

One of the coolest things was the Pokéwalker, where you carrying your pokemon on the Nintendo DS to the Pokéwalker, and as you walked with him, would evolve your pokemon.

### • Pokemon Y / Pokemon Omega Ruby (3DS)

![Pokemon Omega Ruby](/assets/images/posts/games/pokemon-omega-ruby.jpg)

Bro, stop!

Now your game of his childhood in 3D. With amazing features added. To fly to your pokemon by region, change the hairstyle and clothes, ride in pokemon, Walking slowly to catch Pokemon .......

### • Uncharted Series [1,2,3] (PS3)

![Uncharted 3](/assets/images/posts/games/uncharted-3.jpg)

I'm from Indiana Jones fan, so it's not hard to like a game where a guy like Drake who loves a bad joke mixed with the same perspective of "treasure hunt".

PS: The scenarios are monstrously large.

### • Fire Emblem: Awaking (3DS)

![Fire Emblem](/assets/images/posts/games/fire_emblem_awaking.jpg)

Excellent game, with excente gameplay and engaging characters. The game allows
you to create links between these characters and see the result in the future.

### • Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (PS2)

![Kingdom Hearts: Chain of
Memories](/assets/images/posts/games/kingdom_hearts_chains.jpg)

The best thing about this game is the mixture of the Disney universe. In an hour
you are fighting along with Mickey, another time with Cloud Strife.

### • Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley (PSP)

![Harvest Moon: Hero of leaf
valley](/assets/images/posts/games/harvest_moon_hero_of_leaf_valley.jpg)

Same feeling of Harvest moon: back to nature, with some improvements in gameplay
and better graphics. But it was still not enough to be better than the last.

### • Metal Gear Solid 3 (PS2)

### • Assassin's Creed 2 (PS3)

### • Suikoden Tierkreis (Nintendo DS)

### • Final Fantasy Tatics (PS1)

### • Rune Factory 4 (Nintendo 3DS)
