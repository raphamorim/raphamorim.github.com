Two years ago, to be precise Oct 2022, I started Rio Terminal because I wanted to learn Rust and wanted to have a project that I would use in my daily life. I always loved terminals and thought well why not? Truth is that, was such a good investment of my time, not only did I learn Rust but I also met tons of great people and learned that I didn't know anything about how a terminal works.

Time flies like crazy, during Rio development I learned a lot about how a terminal works and user interfaces on terminals (TUI), also got to know different terminal maintainers, TUI libraries, and TUI maintainers... ok I think you got it already. I was completely immersed in the terminal world.

Why am I talking about Rio in this article? Well, because of Rio Terminal's development, I ended up being connected to a company that I have been a fan of (yes, publically a fan) since they started: [Charm](https://charm.sh/). They make terminals look so fun! A terminal does not necessarily need to be a ~boring~ black screen with white text. It can look fantastic, fancy, and glamorous.

Not only do they make terminals look good but they do it in the best [Open Source](https://github.com/charmbracelet/) style. During my first talk with Charm peeps, I was amazed at how talented and skilled each one of them is, so being realistic, I was surprised that I got an offer to work there <3

I am looking forward to working to make the command line glamorous.
