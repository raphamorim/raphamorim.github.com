I left Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon.

I’ve been offline for a week, and I wasn’t planning to write anything about it. But since people started reaching out and asking, I decided to write a short post I can share when needed — and also as a reminder to myself of why I left.

Ever since Twitter’s acquisition, I’ve been asking myself for a long time: Why am I still using this? The place has become completely toxic. While I’ll miss the quick access to information (or at least I think I will), I’m actually grateful not to have it anymore.

Even though I was happy to see alternatives to Twitter, Bluesky and Mastodon never really clicked for me. So, it’s easier to just leave them all behind.

Every week on social media, there was a new topic, a new drama. Honestly, I just want to code. I’m not a developer relations person or anything like that. Discussions about whether to use language X or Y just aren’t my thing. I’d rather spend my time building my own language (which I’m actually doing). But if that’s something you enjoy, please don’t feel judged — everyone has different interests, and as long as it doesn’t offend or attack anyone, I think that’s totally fair.

* Arrivederci — because I’m on my way to Italy to speak at RustLab this year.
