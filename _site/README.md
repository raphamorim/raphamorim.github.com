# [raphamorim.com](http://raphamorim.com)

My personal website where I talk about development. On issues related to JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, Front-End Development and other stuff.

## How it works?

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static generator in Ruby, to create this blog.

## First steps

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/), in case you don't have them yet.

2. Once installed these dependencies, open up the terminal and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the following command:

  ```sh
  $ gem install jekyll
  ```

3. Now clone the project:

  ```sh
  $ git clone git@github.com:raphamorim/raphamorim.github.com.git
  ```

4. Navigate to the project folder:

  ```sh
  $ cd raphamorim.github.com
  ```

5. And finally run:

  ```sh
  $ jekyll
  ```

You'll have access to the website at `http://0.0.0.0:4000/` :D
