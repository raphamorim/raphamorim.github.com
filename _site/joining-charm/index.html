<p>tl;dr: I am so happy to announce that I am joining Charm next year!</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Two years ago, to be precise Oct 2022, I started Rio Terminal because I wanted to learn Rust and wanted to have a project that I would use in my daily life. I always loved terminals and thought well why not? Truth is that, was such a good investment of my time, not only did I learn Rust but I also met tons of great people and learned that I didn’t know anything about how a terminal works.</p>

<p>Time flies like crazy, during Rio development I learned a lot about how a terminal works and user interfaces on terminals (TUI), also got to know different terminal maintainers, TUI libraries, and TUI maintainers… ok I think you got it already. I was completely immersed in the terminal world.</p>

<p>Why am I talking about Rio in this article? Well, because of Rio Terminal’s development, I ended up being connected to a company that I have been a fan of (yes, publically a fan) since they started: <a href="https://charm.sh/">Charm</a>. They make terminals look so fun! A terminal does not necessarily need to be a ~boring~ black screen with white text. It can look fantastic, fancy, and glamorous.</p>

<p>Not only do they make terminals look good but they do it in the best <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/">Open Source</a> style. During my first talk with Charm peeps, I was amazed at how talented and skilled each one of them is, so being realistic, I was surprised that I got an offer to work there &lt;3</p>

<p>I am looking forward to working to make the command line glamorous.</p>
