## About

My name is Raphael, and I am software artisan.

Previously, I worked at companies like Viaplay, Spotify, GoDaddy, and Globo.com. I have been a speaker at a few [conferences](#talks). I am an enthusiast about compilers, WebAssembly, and Rust.

I was responsible for Viaplay's adoption of the Rust language. I built the starter infrastructure, released the first service for production, and actively worked on developing a Rust culture, which led to the language's adoption in the upcoming years, along with many other feats. [See when it all started](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hugoraphael_i-dont-post-very-often-in-the-linkedin-but-activity-6975346956734738432-Csqi).

Currently, I am having fun building a terminal application written in Rust, called [Rio](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio).

I also like to create music. If you want to listen, check out [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/artist/raphael-amorim/1547161397?l=en) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Ij2Lu765q7pjWuXHOUF0s).

Escapades in research and development, ranging from serious research projects to one-off diversions.

		<div class="project">React Ape</div>
		<div class="project-info">React Ape tries to solve same problem that React TV target to fix but uses a different approach. React Ape does not use <i>Document Object Model</i> for rendering, instead uses <i>HTML5 Canvas</i> and WebGL.<br/><br/>
		The reason behind React Ape choices is that craft a high-performance TV user interface based on <i>DOM</i> is a real challenge, because of limited graphics acceleration, single core <i>CPUs</i> and high memory usage for a common TV App. These restrictions make any user experience targetting 60 <i>frames per second</i> quite tricky on the development side. The strategy is step in the renderer based on a hardware-accelerated canvas.<br/><br/>
